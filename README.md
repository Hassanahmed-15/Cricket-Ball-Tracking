Cricket Ball Tracking System
Project Overview
This project is all about tracking a cricket ball in real-time during a match. I built a system that detects and tracks the ball using computer vision techniques. The main tools I used for this project are the YOLOv8 object detection model and Optical Flow, which together allow us to detect and follow the ball’s movement in the video.

How I Did It
1. Detecting the Cricket Ball with YOLOv8
To get started, I trained a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset of cricket ball images. YOLOv8 is a super-efficient model for object detection, meaning it’s great at quickly finding and identifying objects in images. In this case, I used it to find the cricket ball in each frame of the video.

For training, I used the Cricket Ball Dataset for YOLO, which is available on Kaggle. I split the dataset into training and validation sets, and then I used YOLOv8 to teach the model to recognize the ball. Here's the data.yaml file that I used to set things up:

yaml
Copy
train: /kaggle/input/cricket-ball-dataset-for-yolo/cricket_ball_data/train  # Path to training images
val: /kaggle/input/cricket-ball-dataset-for-yolo/cricket_ball_data/valid     # Path to validation images
nc: 1                                 # Number of classes (1 for cricket ball)
names:
  0: cricketBall                     # Name of class 0 is 'cricketBall'
This file tells the model where to find the training and validation data, how many classes (just the cricket ball), and what to call the object it's looking for (cricketBall).

2. Tracking the Ball’s Movement with Optical Flow
Once the ball is detected in each frame, the next step was to track its movement across frames. For this, I used Optical Flow, which helps track the motion of objects between consecutive frames.

In simple terms, Optical Flow calculates how pixels are moving from one frame to the next. By applying this technique, I could predict the trajectory of the cricket ball as it moves through the video, even if the ball moves quickly or changes direction.

3. Putting It All Together
Here’s how it works step-by-step:

YOLOv8 detects the cricket ball in each video frame.

Optical Flow helps track the ball as it moves, giving us a prediction of its path.

Finally, the system visualizes the ball’s movement on the video, showing the trajectory.

4. Video Demo
I recorded a video during a cricket game to demonstrate how the system works. It shows the YOLOv8 model detecting the ball, and Optical Flow tracking its movement frame by frame. The result is a video where you can see the ball’s path as it moves across the field.

Here's the demo video where you can see the system in action:

In the video:

The YOLOv8 model detects the cricket ball.

Optical Flow tracks its motion across frames.

The ball’s trajectory is visualized, showing its predicted path.

Conclusion
With this system, I was able to create a tool that tracks a cricket ball in real-time using a combination of YOLOv8 for object detection and Optical Flow for tracking. It's a great example of how computer vision can be applied to sports analysis, providing valuable insights into the ball's movement during a game.

Feel free to take a look at the project, and if you have any ideas for improvements or want to contribute, I’d love to hear from you!

Notes:
The dataset used for training was sourced from Kaggle.
